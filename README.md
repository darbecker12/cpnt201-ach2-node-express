# cpnt201-ach2-node-express

The node express achievement had multiple ideas that were new to me. With the hello world, there is no html file but the file needs to be ran with node index.js. When creating the script, the port should be specified so that you can display what was made on the localhost. The get will also need a name so that it can be found with localhost:4000/getUsers.
